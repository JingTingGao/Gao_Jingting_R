#Overall Comments: Good exercise! You got the algorithm of ggplot so next step for you should improve the format and make your code more readable.

```{r}
library('ggplot2')
library(reshape2)
data("diamonds")

#1. Create a histogram for every numeric column in the diamonds dataset.

histcarat<-ggplot(diamonds,aes(carat))#create a variable of carat histogram
histcarat+geom_histogram(bins=60)+ggtitle("Carat Histogram")+xlim(0,3)#plot the carat histogram, name it as Carat Histogram, read the distribution, and remove the outliers.

histdepth<-ggplot(diamonds,aes(depth))#create a variable of depth histogram
histdepth+geom_histogram(bins=60)+ggtitle("Depth Histogram")+xlim(55,70)#plot the depth histogram, name it as Depth Histogram, read the distribution, and remove the outliers.

histtable<-ggplot(diamonds,aes(table))#create a variable of table histogram
histtable+geom_histogram(bins=40)+ggtitle("Table Histogram")+xlim(50,70)#plot the table histogram, name it as Table Histogram, read the distribution, and remove the outliers.

histprice<-ggplot(diamonds,aes(depth))#create a variable of price histogram
histprice+geom_histogram(bins=60)+ggtitle("Price Histogram")+xlim(50,75)#plot the price histogram, name it as Price Histogram, read the distribution, and remove the outliers. 

histx<-ggplot(diamonds,aes(x))#create a variable of x histogram
histx+geom_histogram(bins=60)+ggtitle("X Histogram")+xlim(3,10)#plot the x histogram, name it as X Histogram, read the distribution, and remove the outliers.

histy<-ggplot(diamonds,aes(y))#create a variable of y histogram
histy+geom_histogram(bins=180)+ggtitle("Y Histogram")+xlim(3,10)#plot the y histogram, name it as Y Histogram, read the distribution, and remove the outliers.

histz<-ggplot(diamonds,aes(z))#create a variable of z histogram,
histz+geom_histogram(bins=60)+ggtitle("Z Histogram")+xlim(2,6)#plot the z histogram, name it as Z Histogram, read the distribution, and remove the outliers.

#Comments: I do see your code works for this problem. But I just want to point out that you actually have better way to do this. One way should be filter out all the numeric variables and then use one loop draw the histograms for each. This way should be more clear and readable.

#2. Create a simple scatter plot of Weight (“Carat”) and Price using Color (the “Color” column in the diamonds dataframe) as a facet. This might the precursor for developing a model to predict price given some characteristic like weight. Notice that the relationship is non-linear. If we wanted to build a linear model, this would violate one of the assumptions.

scatplot <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=(price), colour=color))#create a variable of scatter plot, set carat to x axis, price to y axis, and color to colour
scatplot <- scatplot + geom_point(size=0.8) + ggtitle("Diamonds - Weight to Price by Color") + xlab("Weight")#plot the data on a scatter plot, titling the graph, x-axis, y-axis, and key as appropriate(reschedual the size of the points)
scatplot <- scatplot + ylab("Price") + labs(colour = "factor(color)")
print(scatplot)#print the final scatter plot

#Comments: This code works in this problem and I do see your understanding in the layer ploting thought in ggplot. But I suggest one better format that you can refer to 
ggplot(diamonds,aes(carat,price))+geom_point(aes(color=factor(color)))+labs(title="Diamonds-Weight to Price by Color",x='Weight',y='Price')

#3. All Groups: Let’s remove the non-linearity and replot. Think about transforming both price and weight. Given that we are working with dollars (Price); the first transformation we might try is the natural log. Add the transformed columns to the dataframe and replot.

scatlin <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=log(carat), y=log(price), colour=color))#create a variable of scatter linear, set log(carat) to x axis, log(price) to y axis, and color to colour
scatlin <- scatlin + geom_point(size=0.8) + ggtitle("Diamonds - Weight to Price (Linear)") + xlab("Weight")
# plot the data on a scatter plot, titling the graph, x-axis, y-axis, and key as appropriate
scatlin <- scatlin + ylab("Price") + labs(colour = "factor(color)")
print(scatlin)#print the final scatter plot

#4. All Groups: Remove the linear trend (create a linear model and use the transformed weight on the x-axis and the residuals on the y-axis). If there is a relationship that can be modeled with a linear regression model, then the residuals should be randomly distributed. The resulting plot visually indicates there is possibly some heteroscedasticity to manage.

linear <- lm(log(price) ~ log(carat), data = diamonds) #create a variable linear that fit a linear model of the log of price to the log of carat by using the diamonds dataset
residual <- resid(linear) #extract model residuals from the above linear model and assign the values to the variable residual
weightprice <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=log(carat), y=residual, colour=color)) 
#create a variable weightprice to be a ggplot object by using diamonds dataset, the x axis is log(carat), the y axis is residual, and the colour is color
weightprice <- weightprice + geom_point() + ggtitle("Diamonds - Weight to Price by Color") + theme(legend.position="top", plot.title = element_text(color = "Blue", size = 14)) 
#plot a linear scatter plot, titling the graph, and use theme() function to edit the title
weightprice <- weightprice+ xlab("Weight") + ylab("Price Residuals") + labs(colour = "factor(color)") #x-axis is "Weight" and y-axis is "Price Residuals"
print(weightprice) #print the final scatter plot

```
